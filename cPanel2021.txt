Types of plugins

cPanel & WHM offers third-party developers the ability to create applications that can be used within WHM, cPanel, or Webmail.  Even though there are three locations that applications can be created within the software, there is just one set of instructions that the developer needs to be aware of to use.

This course will cover the basic structure of plugin development so that the developer knows that the application code will integrate with the cPanel software.

**WHM plugins**
Root or Reseller level applications only.  These programs will only be available to the system administrator of the server where they are installed

**cPanel plugins**
User-level applications only.  These programs are available to users who fall within the correct ACLs assigned to them.  They will only appear in the cPanel UI if the user has rights to use the application

**Webmail plugins**
Only available to the webmail user who has the right to access the application

Configuration

* **Plugin** — A plugin modifies an interface’s features or functionality, and it may also include changes to the interface’s appearance.

  * You can write plugins for the cPanel or WHM interfaces.

  * You can use the cPanel Style Guide to ensure that your interfaces match the appearance of standard cPanel interfaces.

  * For more information, read our Guide to cPanel Plugins documentation.
